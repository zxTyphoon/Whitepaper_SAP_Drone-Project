\section*{Abstract}
This paper presents the development of two \acp{PoC} for the \ac{ASTRID} project, 
an initiative at SAP Labs India aimed at leveraging \acp{LLM} for voice-controlled drone operations. 

The first \ac{PoC} explores the application of few-shot prompting to generate precise drone command sequences, demonstrated through a PyGame simulation environment. 
It highlights the iterative refinement of prompts to handle varying complexity in user inputs, enabling intuitive and accurate drone behavior.

The second \ac{PoC} addresses real-time video streaming challenges, transitioning from high-latency YouTube-based streaming to an NGINX \ac{RTMP} server. 
This approach achieved a significant reduction in latency to approximately 1-2 seconds, enhancing the responsiveness and usability of drone video feeds for real-world applications.

Together, these \acp{PoC} showcase the potential of integrating \acp{LLM} with drone technology to enable seamless voice control and improved real-time feedback. 
The findings lay the groundwork for further advancements in voice-controlled drone systems, particularly in applications like surveillance, remote monitoring, and emergency response.
