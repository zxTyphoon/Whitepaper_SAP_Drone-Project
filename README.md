# ASTRID Project: Leveraging LLMs for Voice-Controlled Drone Operations

## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files and the compiled PDF for the white paper titled **"Exploring Voice-Controlled Drone Technology: PoC Development for SAP Labs India"**.

### Abstract
This paper presents the development of two Proofs of Concept (PoCs) for the Autonomous System for Remote and Intelligent Drone operations (ASTRID) project, an initiative at SAP Labs India aimed at leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for voice-controlled drone operations.

The first PoC explores the application of few-shot prompting to generate precise drone command sequences, demonstrated through a PyGame simulation environment. It highlights the iterative refinement of prompts to handle varying complexity in user inputs, enabling intuitive and accurate drone behavior.

The second PoC addresses real-time video streaming challenges, transitioning from high-latency YouTube-based streaming to an NGINX Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server. This approach achieved a significant reduction in latency to approximately 1-2 seconds, enhancing the responsiveness and usability of drone video feeds for real-world applications.

Together, these PoCs showcase the potential of integrating LLMs with drone technology to enable seamless voice control and improved real-time feedback. The findings lay the groundwork for further advancements in voice-controlled drone systems, particularly in applications like surveillance, remote monitoring, and emergency response.
